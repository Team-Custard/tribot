## Team Custard revival project
Hello from 2024. This is the legacy archival project of TriBot. TriBot was a simplistic bot created in mid-2021 designed initially as a private bot for the a defunct Vtuber on YouTube. The server owner and bot developer has parted ways a few months later and TriBot has become public for anyone to use. The bot has been superceded by Custard. The bot remains active for archival purposes.

# Original Description (2021):

## This project was discontinued in favor of [Custard](https://custard.spongey.ga)
Use custard instead of TriBot. Custard has most of TriBot's commands in it, and is the latest. You can suggest features to be added to Custard in the discord server.

# TriBot
Tribot was a modbot + utility bot. Originally a private bot designed for [MaloDaFurry](https://www.youtube.com/c/Malo1471)'s discord server, and later made public. The bot was since invited to 136 discord servers before it was deleted.

### Why replit?
You really think I'll treat the bot like a special bot? Hell nah. No mongodb, or vps for this cringe.

### Why discontinue this?
The bot was ruined from the start. It never followed basic rate limits, never checked permissions propperly, barely even worked. A remake was neccesary, I decided to shut down the bot on September 10, 2021. Since then, I've been working on my new bot, Custard.

### Self hosting
I will not provide any info on how to host this hell hole, you're on your own.
